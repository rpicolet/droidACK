droid Active Control Kit (droidACK) is a library supporting an MVC-like 
architectural pattern (also named droidAck) tailored to Android apps with 
complex UI behaviors; use of the pattern is enabled by the Kit, and 
vice versa.
 
NOTE: this is an early "developer release" of a work-in-progress, intended
to solicit feedback and determine whether to pursue further development.
